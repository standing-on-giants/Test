This project was made while learning how to use Git and GitHub

Here, we use the tensorLy library to perform tensor decomposition (tucker decomposition to be precise) on an image to reduce space complexity.
After the decomposition, we reconstruct back the original image & then compare the quality change w.r.t the original image
